# PyBer_Analysis (purpose)
Analysis of large spreadsheets based on ride sharing in 2019 using Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, and Anaconda to derermine affordability for certain neighborhoods.
--------------
# The subjects discussed are:
  # - Total Fares
  # - Total Rides
  # - Total Drivers
  # - Average fare per ride and driver
  # - Total fare by city type
  # - Box and Whisker of Ride Count Data
--------------
# Resouces
  - city_data.csv and ride_data.csv

# Results
  # FARES BY CITY TYPE
![Fig5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107223178/179078589-a8d32683-8c50-4b95-ba97-46e67ac462cf.png)
  - Here we can see that the urban areas hold most of the fares by city type (62.7%). Rural only contributed about 7% while suburban neighborhoods were just over 30%.
--------------
  # RIDES BY CITY TYPE
![Fig6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107223178/179078490-9b3a8289-bd87-4b34-8e39-e3d45695a309.png)
  - Much like the prior, the urban neighborhoods heavily outweigh the other two categories at almost 70% of the total. Suburban areas possess roughly 1/3 of the rides while rural has just 5.3%.
--------------
  # DRIVERS BY CITY TYPE
![Fig7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107223178/179078563-784a6b31-198b-419f-9e5a-38ca9004ddcf.png)
  - As far as drivers for the categories go, urban cities drivers had about 80% of the total drivers and suburban drivers coming in at 16.5% while the rural drivers hold little over 2.5% of total drivers.
--------------
  # AVERAGE FARE PER RIDE AND DRIVER
![Fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107223178/179078728-05686182-4275-4ba2-94da-75f01544d4de.png)
  - The bubble chart above shows the relationship between the average fare price and the total number of rides and drivers based on city types. If we look at the graph we can see that the price for ride share is significantly lower in urban areas as opposed to the rural ones. This is due to the demand based on the amount provided in the rural cities. It can also be noticed that the bubbles seem to get larger as the total number of rides increases.

  # FARE BY CITY TYPE

  - The line chart above displays the trend in total fare from Jan-April in 2019.

  # RIDE COUNT DATA

  - The graphic above shows a box and whisker plot of the data describing where you can find the averages of the rides (based on fare) and how much they fluctuate (based on the outliers, or, "the extremes"). 
--------------
# Summary
  - The big takeaway is that the urban cities will always have the highest percentages of all. The higher the number of drivers, the more reasonable the price of rides. When there is a surplus of available drivers, the price inevitabley goes down. On the scatter plot, we notice some urban cities with low number of drivers and low average fare but pretty high count of rides. Cross-examining the economic infrastructure and population of certain cities might provide a better answer for the disparities amongst all the cities.
